# Expert-Decision-Replay-Platform-Group-2

A full-stack platform for recording organizational decisions — the problem, the alternatives
considered, who reviewed and approved it, and the final outcome — so teams can learn from past
decisions instead of repeating mistakes.

Built as a personal deep-dive project for Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 7.0.

## Features

**Authentication & Access**
- JWT-based login/registration with bcrypt password hashing
- Role-Based Access Control: Employee, Reviewer, Manager, Administrator
- Centralized frontend error handling with automatic session-expiry redirect

**Team Management**
- Admins create teams and assign managers
- Managers can add/remove members for their own team only
- Admins can manage every team system-wide

**Decision Management**
- Create, edit, search, and filter decisions
- Automatic version history — every edit is snapshotted before it's applied
- Alternative analysis (pros/cons/cost/feasibility/risk) per decision
- File attachments (upload/download/delete)
- Threaded comments with soft-delete (preserved for audit, hidden from view)

**Multi-Level Approval Workflow**
- Decisions route through Reviewer → Manager → Administrator, in strict order
- Rejection at any level immediately finalizes the decision
- Full approval history with reviewer names, outcomes, and comments

**Dashboards & Reporting**
- Role-specific dashboards (Employee / Manager / Administrator)
- Admin system-wide statistics (users, teams, decisions by status)
- Audit log of all significant actions (Admin-only)
- In-app notifications with unread count and mark-as-read
- PDF export (single decision) and Excel export (all decisions)

**Design**
- A custom "case file" visual identity — dark desk background, cream paper cards,
  tilted rubber-stamp badges for roles/statuses, serif + monospace typography

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js + npm
- PostgreSQL (local or hosted, e.g. Supabase)

### Backend

```bash
cd edrp-backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy .env.example to .env and fill in your own values
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
Interactive API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

### Frontend

```bash
cd edrp-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

```
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
JWT_SECRET_KEY=any_long_random_string
```

`database.py` builds the connection URL safely using `URL.create()`, which handles special
characters in the password automatically.
